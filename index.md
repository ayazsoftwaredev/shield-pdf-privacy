Shield PDF built the Shield PDF app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Ayaz Software at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

**Shield PDF is an offline-first application.**

* **File Processing:** All PDF operations (including merging, splitting, encrypting, decrypting, and converting) are performed **locally on your device**. Your files are never uploaded to our servers, stored by us, or shared with third parties.
* **AI Features:** Features such as "Text to PDF" utilize your device's processing power. Input text is not sent to our servers.

## 2. Permissions Required

To provide specific features, the app may require the following permissions:

* **Storage Access:** Required to select PDF and image files from your device, process them, and save the modified files back to your storage.
* **Camera:** Required only when using "OCR Scan" or "ID Card Scan" features to capture images of documents. These images are processed locally and are not sent externally.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The app may use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you (e.g., for crash reporting or analytics to improve the app stability).

## 4. Security

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information. Since we do not collect personal files on our servers, the risk of data leakage is minimal. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Note:** Passwords you set for encrypted files are your sole responsibility. We cannot view, recover, or reset passwords for your encrypted PDFs.
